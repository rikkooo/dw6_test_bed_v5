# DW6 Protocol Issues - Cycle 1 Evaluation

This document tracks issues, flaws, and potential improvements discovered during the evaluation of the DW6 protocol.

## 1. Environment Setup and Dependency Installation

- **Issue:** The virtual environment (`venv`) creation and/or the installation of project dependencies via `pip install -e .[test]` is not robust. The user reported that the environment was not created and dependencies were missing.
- **Impact:** Critical. The project is not usable out-of-the-box, which defeats the purpose of an automated setup workflow.
- **Suggestion:** The setup script must:
    1.  Reliably create the Python virtual environment.
    2.  Verify the environment's existence and activation.
    3.  Install all necessary dependencies from `pyproject.toml` into the venv.
    4.  Provide clear success or failure feedback for this entire process.

## 2. GitHub Integration

- **Issue:** The workflow requires manual entry of GitHub information in a separate UI step, even after the repository has been created and linked via the command line during setup.
- **Impact:** Poor user experience and redundancy. The DW6 engine should automatically detect the existing Git configuration (`.git/config`).
- **Suggestion:** The DW6 engine should be updated to parse the remote origin URL from the local Git configuration, eliminating the need for the user to re-enter this information.

## 3. Programmatic GitHub Authentication

- **Issue:** The workflow triggers a UI-based authentication prompt for GitHub operations (`git push`). This breaks the command-line-native experience and prevents full automation.
- **Impact:** Prevents unattended execution of the workflow and requires manual intervention, which is a major flaw for an automated protocol.
- **Suggestion:** Implement support for a `.env` file at the project root. The scripts should load a `GITHUB_TOKEN` or similar variable from this file to authenticate with GitHub programmatically. The setup process should also guide the user in creating this file if it doesn't exist.
