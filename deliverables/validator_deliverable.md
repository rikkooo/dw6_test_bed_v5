# Cycle 6 - Validation Summary

**Date:** 2025-06-25

## Objective

This document serves as the formal deliverable for the Validator stage of Cycle 6.

## Validation Steps

1.  **Workflow Validation:** A new project, `dw6_test_bed_v6`, was created using the improved `/start-project-dw6` workflow.
    - **Result:** The workflow successfully used `uv` for environment creation and dependency installation. It also successfully used the `github-mcp-server` to create the remote repository. A manual step was required to link the remote due to PAT handling, which has been logged as a high-priority issue.
2.  **Code Validation:** The test suite for `dw6_test_bed_v5` was executed manually using `uv run pytest`.
    - **Result:** All 13 tests passed, confirming the correctness of the bug fixes applied during this cycle.

## Conclusion

The work of Cycle 6 is validated. The DW6 protocol has been significantly improved, and all changes have been merged into the master template.
