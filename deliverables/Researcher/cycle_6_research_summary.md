# Cycle 6 - Research Summary

**Date:** 2025-06-25

## Objective

To provide the Coder with a clear, proven implementation path for the tasks defined in the Cycle 6 Technical Specification. The research for this cycle was practical and involved prototyping solutions to the identified issues.

## Research Findings & Implementation Guide

### 1. Environment Setup with `uv`

- **Finding:** The use of `uv` is significantly more reliable and faster than the standard `venv` and `pip` modules. The commands `uv venv` and `uv pip install -e .[test]` were successful in creating the environment and installing dependencies without issue.
- **Guidance for Coder:** The `start-project-dw6.md` workflow script should be updated to execute these `uv` commands instead of the previous `python -m venv` and `pip` commands.

### 2. Automated GitHub Repository Creation

- **Finding:** The `github-mcp-server` provides a seamless, programmatic way to create and configure GitHub repositories. The `create_repository` tool, combined with a stored PAT for authentication, successfully automated the entire process.
- **Guidance for Coder:** The `start-project-dw6.md` workflow should be modified to call the `github-mcp-server`'s `create_repository` tool. The remote URL should then be added to the local git configuration automatically, using the PAT for authentication in the URL string.

### 3. CLI Command Bug Fixes

- **Finding:** The bugs in the `dw6` CLI were straightforward to resolve. The fixes involved correcting method names, printing returned values, and using the correct dictionary keys.
- **Guidance for Coder:**
  - **`status` command (AttributeError):** In `src/dw6/cli.py`, confirm the change from `manager.get_status()` to `manager.get_state()`.
  - **`status` command (Silent Output):** In `src/dw6/cli.py`, confirm the implementation of a loop that prints the key-value pairs from the `manager.get_state()` dictionary.
  - **`engineer start` command (KeyError):** In `src/dw6/cli.py`, confirm the change from `state['Cycle']` to `state['RequirementPointer']`.
  - **`approve` command (Confusing Log):** In `src/dw6/state_manager.py`, confirm that the stage name is captured *before* the transition and used in the final approval message.

## Conclusion

The research confirms that the implementation plan outlined in the technical specification is sound and has been validated through practical application. The Coder can proceed with confidence.
